# Crowd Flow Prediction
This project uses a transformer-based model to predict how crowds move in busy scenes. It takes in the positions of agents, the layout of the environment—including walkable and non-walkable areas—and the agents’ goals. Based on this information, the model learns to estimate the likely movement patterns and generates a flow map of the crowd.

## Model Overview
This model uses a hierarchical transformer design to predict crowd flow. It combines global and local context information, allowing better learning of patterns and interactions within complex crowd scenes.

**Inputs:**
- Agent Map (`A`) — where people are
- Environment Map (`E`) — obstacles, layout
- Goal Map (`G`) — destination/attraction zones

**Output:**
- Predicted flow map

## How to Run

### 1. Install Requirements

<pre lang="md">
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>

### 2. Train the Model

<pre lang="md">
python train.py --data_dir ./dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 8
</pre>

This will train the Restormer-based model on your dataset using the provided Agent, Environment, and Goal maps. Checkpoints will be saved to the checkpoints/ directory by default.

### 3. Test the Model

<pre lang="md">
python test.py --model_path ./checkpoints/best_model.pt --data_dir ./dataset
</pre>

This will load the trained model and generate flow predictions. Output predictions will be saved to the predictions/ folder inside the working directory.
